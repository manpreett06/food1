                    There's a good chance you might run into Chef Guto Souza if you visit one of Bengaluru's most
                    happening F&B hotspots. It's his passion for his native Brazilian cuisine that was the catalyst for Boteco which generally 
                    refers to a place for great drinks and easy conversation. Boteco captures the essence of a Brazilian watering hole with an
                    emphasis on high-quality and delicious food. The interiors are vibrant with plenty of natural light and stunning murals that
                    are good for the 'gram'.
